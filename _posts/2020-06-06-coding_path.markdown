At first, I wasn’t sure how to start this blog.  There were a number of reasons why I wanted to get started that it became a bit of a nightmare to begin.  However, after a bit of free writing and sorting I was finally able to  narrow down my top 3 results.

The first reason is that I always want more flexibility in my life. While coding doesn’t provide immunity to large scale issues such as security during a pandemic, it does give greater options because it opens your potential job access into practically any company.  Also, with this field it further opens up further to remote work viability.  

Further, this blends Into my second reason - acquiring marketable skills.  This coincides with the process of gamifying ones life.  There is always something new to learn and challenge yourself with on a daily basis.  While I admit as a beginner this can be a bit much but I expect that after some time you can find the path which fits your personality.

Lastly, this brings me to my final reason, problem solving.  I found that I enjoy spending a lot of  time figuring out solutions and/or getting things done more efficiently.  As a programmer, this seems to be at the heart of the industry.
